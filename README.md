Data Engineering Zoomcamp Implementation 
# ðŸš€ Data Engineering Zoomcamp Project

This repository contains my work through the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) by DataTalks.Club. The course provides hands-on experience with building a complete data engineering pipeline using modern tools like Docker, Terraform, Airflow, BigQuery, dbt, and Looker Studio.

## ðŸ§± Project Architecture

The project simulates a real-world data pipeline that:

1. Ingests raw taxi data (in Parquet/CSV format)
2. Stores it in Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
3. Loads and transforms it in BigQuery
4. Models and analyzes it with dbt
5. Visualizes insights in Looker Studio
